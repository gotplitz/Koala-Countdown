# Koala - Frontend Engineering Challenge

## Norman's Assignment
Hi, I'm done creating the countdown app. I added a date picker so the customer can chose and change the date and time whenever they want, plus I added localStorage, so even if you close the browser, the countdown will keep the date set by the user. I hope you like it.

It took me like 5 hours because I'm still getting familiar with Typescript.
